# Heliocentric_EtoM_OT
Input initial conditions (corresponding to Earth) and final conditions (corresponding to Mars).

Output should be a plot of the position and velocity of the spacecraft over time and a plot of 
the acceleration over time.

## Addendum
Run the file labeled HelioOrbitTransferVisicMain.m ONLY. All three files are necessary for the code to work.
